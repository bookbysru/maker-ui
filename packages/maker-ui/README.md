# Maker UI

> This project is currently under development.

> If you arrived here from the Gatsby Theme Store, Gatsby Theme Elements is no longer supported and has now become a React component library. Consider trying `packages/gatsby-starter-maker-ui` for your project instead.

Build React apps with a responsive layout system powered by [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/).

Maker UI helps you design accessible, responsive page templates that can be customized in an infinite number of ways. Use it to quickly prototype and deploy a polished application layout so you can focus on developing great content or adding new integrations and features to your project.

Maker UI extends all of Theme UI's core features so you can easily migrate your existing theme.

## Getting Started

```sh
npm i maker-ui
```

Maker UI uses two configuration objects and optional custom components to build your layouts. Your custom theme and options configurations determine how each layout should behave and appear.

See the documentation on how to build a theme and configure your layout options.

### Template Component

To get a site up and running in less than 5 minutes, you can use the `Template` component. Simply import and supply your theme object, options object, menu array, and logo as props:

```jsx
// basic template usage
import React from 'react'
import { Template } from 'maker-ui'

import theme from './my-theme'
import options from './my-options'
import menu from './my-menu'
import Logo from './Logo'

export default props => (
  <Template theme={theme} options={options} menu={menu} logo={<Logo />}>
    {props.children}
  </Template>
)
```

The `Template` component accepts a variety of props for custom components like a sidebar, side nav, header widgets (ie. search or social media links), footer content, and much more. Check out the [Template docs](https://maker-ui.com/docs/template) for details.

### Layout Components

If your design requires a bit more customization or if you need conditional layouts depending on a page route or variable, you can build with Maker UI's layout components:

```jsx
// basic layout component usage
import React from 'react'
import {
  Layout,
  Header,
  Navbar,
  MobileMenu,
  Content,
  Main,
  Sidebar,
  Footer,
} from 'maker-ui'

import theme from './my-theme'
import options from './my-options'
import menu from './my-menu'
import Logo from './Logo'

export default props => (
  <Layout theme={theme} options={options}>
    <Header>
      <Navbar logo={<Logo />} menu={menu} />
      <MobileMenu menu={menu} />
    </Header>
    <Content>
      <Main>{props.children}</Main>
      <Sidebar>Your custom sidebar component</Sidebar>
    </Content>
    <Footer>Your custom footer</Footer>
  </Layout>
)
```

All layout components can be styled with custom variants and the `sx` prop.
